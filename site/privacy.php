	<p>accountless means we need to track your ip address to know who you are. this means that 
	certain activities on the site, like votes, might be visible to anyone
	sharing your ip. we try to be as transparent as possible, but keeping this data
	is required for us to prevent abuse.</p>
	
	<p>when you connect to matbox, an anonymous identity will be created for your ip.
	matbox promises to not share your ip with anyone.</p>
