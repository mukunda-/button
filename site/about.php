	<p>welcome. load the page and you will be presented with <b>matter</b>. 
	put a <b>star</b> on the matter or press the <b>X</b> to make it go away. if you star
	matter you will not be able to analyse other new matter until it
	becomes <b>old</b>. create submatter by typing in the box below the matter. </p>
	
	<p>if you are lucky, you will be presented with the composition page. 
	you may then <b>compose</b> your own matter for analysis.</p>
	
	<p>matter gets old after a while. old matter cannot be further analysed, 
	and bad matter gets buried. 
	if matter ends up with a rating of 99, 
	it is the <b>Mythic Matter</b>. my people have been in search of the 
	Mythic Matter for the last 400,000 years. please help us find it.</p>
	
	<p>by the way, to embed content in your matter, surround the URL in brackets. 
	images appear as tiny cells at first, click on them to use your microscope.</p>
