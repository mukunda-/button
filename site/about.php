	<p>the quest for the legendary matter</p>
	
	<p>load the page and you will be presented with matter. 
	put a star on the matter or press the X to make it go away. if you star
	matter you will not be able to analyse other new matter until it
	becomes old.
	create submatter by typing in the box below the matter. </p>
	
	<p>if you are lucky, you will be presented with the composition page. 
	you may then compose your own matter for analysis.</p>
	
	<p>after a while, matter gets old, and bad matter gets buried. old matter
	cannot be further analysed. if old matter has a score of 99, it is then the legendary matter.</p>
	
	<p>there are no rules. everything is anonymous. good luck.</p>
	
	<p>by the way, to put an image in your matter, surround an image url in brackets.</p>
