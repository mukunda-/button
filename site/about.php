	<p>hello. load the page and you will be presented with <b>matter</b>. 
	put a <b>star</b> on the matter or press the <b>X</b> to make it go away. if you star
	matter you will not be able to analyse other new matter until it
	becomes <b>old</b>. create submatter by typing in the box below the matter. </p>
	
	<p>if you are lucky, you will be presented with the composition page. 
	you may then <b>compose</b> your own matter for analysis.</p>
	
	<p>when matter gets <b>old</b>, it cannot be processed further, and it's moved to the archive for research or buried if it's useless.
	
	if matter ends up with a rating of 99, 
	it is the <b>Perfect Matter</b>. we have been searching for the
	Perfect Matter for over 400,000 years. please help us find it.</p>
