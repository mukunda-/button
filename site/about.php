	<p>the matter machine</p>
	
	<p>welcome. load the page and you will be presented with <i>matter</i>. 
	put a star on the matter or press the X to make it go away. if you star
	matter you will not be able to analyse other new matter until it
	becomes old.
	create submatter by typing in the box below the matter. </p>
	
	<p>if you are lucky, you will be presented with the composition page. 
	you may then compose your own matter for analysis.</p>
	
	<p>matter gets old after a while. old matter cannot be further analysed, 
	and bad matter gets buried. 
	if matter ends up with a rating of 99, 
	it is then the Legendary Matter. my people have been in search of the 
	Legendary Matter for the last 400,000 years.</p>
	
	<p>there are no rules. everything is anonymous. good luck.</p>
	
	<p>by the way, to put an image in your matter, surround an image url in brackets. 
	images appear as tiny cells at first, click on them to use your microscope.</p>
